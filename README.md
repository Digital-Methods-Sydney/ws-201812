Topic models allow you to find topics and relationship among documents in large collections of texts. There is a (growing) number of approaches to explore and make statistical inferences about texts. This session will provide a hands-on introduction to text analysis and topic modelling using *[stm: An R package for Structural Topic Models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/index.html)*.  `stm`  is a comprehensive and highly regarded package to prepare, model and visualise textual data. The session will be mainly practical but I will also provide a short theoretical introduction to topic models and present some applications of `stm` we can currently find in the literature. In this session, we will walk the length of a standard pipeline for textual analysis. We will explore different techniques and methods to import texts and associated metadata into R from a variety of sources such as PDFs, webpages, spreadsheets and [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). We will prepare the data and clean the text using Hadley Wickham's "tidy" approach. We will compute document term matrices and discuss the benefits of different weighting techniques. Finally, we will estimate, evaluate and visualise topic models to facilitate their interpretation and to communicate the result of the analysis.

Requirements for attendance:

* Bring your own laptop;
* Preinstall [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop);
* Install the R packages `stm`, `tidyverse`, `tidytext` and `quanteda` with the command `install.packages(c('stm', 'tidyverse', 'tidytext', 'tidytext'))`;
* Check that every package loads without error (e.g. `library(stm)`) as you might need to reinstall some other package;
* The day before the session, download the entire repository of the session materials from [GitHub](https://github.com/Digital-Methods-Sydney/ws-201808/archive/master.zip) to have the most recent version of the scripts and data.
